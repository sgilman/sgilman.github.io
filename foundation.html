        			<p class="lead mb-5">Coastal communities around the world face an imminent and accelerating threat from rising seas and more frequent extreme storms. Coordinated, regional adaptation strategies such as building hard barriers, growing wetlands and managing retreat are needed to adapt effectively and expediently. However, coastal areas often have many overlapping restrictions and guidelines dictated by various jurisdictions, posing planners with decision-making and implementation barriers. Regulations, common law interpretation of policy, insurance incentives from the federal to the local level, as well as design guidelines, overlap and are often difficult to navigate, making it difficult to effectively plan for coastal adaptation. This research proposes a method to visualize overlapping land use, zoning and regulation that reveals the impact of new adaptation policy on the form and function of coastal cities. This visualization enables a clear, common understanding of how these regulation affect spatial decisions for urban planners.
              <p class="lead mb-5">
              Foundation is a 3D web mapping application that compiles and visualizes coastal land use law and environmental regulation in several North American cities.  Foundation combines municipal datasets including zoning codes, current land use, building footprints, parcels, and projected storm surges into a spatially enabled relational database and uses spatial analysis to determine development restrictions on a parcel-by-parcel basis. It also enables 3D simulations of a maximum build-out under current conditions and under projections of future sea level rise and storm surge scenarios to guide coastal planning efforts. Finally, Foundationâ€™s interface allows planners to virtually modify land use regulations to determine how to best meet their adaption goals.
              </p>
              <p class="lead mb-5">The foundation team consists of Collyn Chan, Mario Giampieri, and Scott Gilman. Scott and Collyn are current Master of City Planning students at MIT. Mario graduated with his MCP in 2018 and currently works at the Leventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism.
