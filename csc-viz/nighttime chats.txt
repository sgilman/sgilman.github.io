10/25/18, 7:57 AM - Scott Gilman: <Media omitted>
10/25/18, 8:59 AM - Collyn Chan: ....why did he do that
10/25/18, 9:00 AM - Scott Gilman: literally no idea
10/25/18, 9:00 AM - Scott Gilman: we had a VERY CLEAR task list
10/25/18, 9:01 AM - Scott Gilman: and honestly if you're not going to get a quote like you SAID you would, your first thought is to have RUTH, in all of her free time, edit a fucking google translation of our DRAFT????
10/25/18, 9:01 AM - Collyn Chan: What the hell man!!! >:(!!!!
10/25/18, 9:01 AM - Collyn Chan: I know I was like why would you ask her
10/25/18, 9:01 AM - Collyn Chan: Omg
10/25/18, 9:01 AM - Collyn Chan: I can't
10/25/18, 9:01 AM - Collyn Chan: Can we tell lily
10/25/18, 9:02 AM - Collyn Chan: I have no idea what to do but that sounds better than nothing
10/25/18, 9:03 AM - Scott Gilman: its awkward that i'm the only person cc'd on this bc i want to address it with the class but that would seem weird if i shared this with everyone else. but i have felt for a while that we are asking too much of ruth's time and this is way out of bounds.
10/25/18, 9:03 AM - Scott Gilman: but yeah i think starting with lily is a good idea
10/25/18, 9:04 AM - Collyn Chan: ME TOO. What the fuck it's so rude and so not what we agreed upon oh my god
10/25/18, 9:04 AM - Collyn Chan: Like imagine someone said that to you
10/25/18, 9:04 AM - Collyn Chan: Oh my god
10/25/18, 9:04 AM - Collyn Chan: I think you're the only one that can bring it up though :///
10/25/18, 9:05 AM - Scott Gilman: yeah i think that's true
10/25/18, 9:05 AM - Collyn Chan: But I think bringing it up to lily would be better than forwarding to class maybe idk lily is pretty responsive
10/25/18, 9:05 AM - Collyn Chan: You can ask on whatsapp
10/25/18, 9:06 AM - Collyn Chan: This feels urgent I turned around and came back -
10/25/18, 9:06 AM - Collyn Chan: No more sleepinggg
10/25/18, 9:06 AM - Scott Gilman: yeah i will whatsapp lily. i'm in class now but i can do it right after
10/25/18, 9:07 AM - Scott Gilman: also i didn't include this in the screenshot but ruth already replied and said she's too busy to do it this week. so it's not urgent in the sense that we need to stop it from happening right now
10/25/18, 9:09 AM - Collyn Chan: That's good
10/25/18, 9:09 AM - Collyn Chan: Agreed. Just urgent in the sense of respecting her and how this is inappropriate
10/25/18, 9:10 AM - Scott Gilman: yes definitely
10/25/18, 9:14 AM - Collyn Chan: Also radio ://
10/25/18, 9:14 AM - Collyn Chan: Are you going to dance practice after?
10/25/18, 9:16 AM - Scott Gilman: yeah. haven't decided if i will go late to the 6:30 or just join the 8:00 one
10/25/18, 11:00 AM - Scott Gilman: so apparently david asked lily and someone at MITEI to do the translation editing first, and then she recommended that ruth look at it because of the legalese
10/25/18, 11:01 AM - Collyn Chan: ----------------------
10/25/18, 11:01 AM - Scott Gilman: which makes his email seem less random and makes me feel better about our relationship with ruth. but like he still explicitly did not do what we agreed on and didn't let us know
10/25/18, 11:01 AM - Collyn Chan: But whyyyy
10/25/18, 11:01 AM - Scott Gilman: and his way of letting me know was so out of context
10/25/18, 11:01 AM - Collyn Chan: Yeah
10/25/18, 11:01 AM - Collyn Chan: But why did he ask Ruth she does so much for us already
10/25/18, 11:02 AM - Collyn Chan: And why did he use google translate omg
10/25/18, 11:02 AM - Collyn Chan: Like I don't understand why. It's not even ready
10/25/18, 11:02 AM - Scott Gilman: so this is what lily said: "He sent an email to myself and Jose Soto (an undergrad from MITEI) to the same effect. I had no background on the situation or decisions made in class and did spend some time yesterday during evening fixing some of the translation. I did write a note to him saying it'd be good to get Ruth to look at it before sending it out anywhere else, as she is a native speaker and would be able to attest to some of the translation of the legalese."
10/25/18, 11:02 AM - Collyn Chan: There's no pretext that we wanted to emphasize
10/25/18, 11:02 AM - Scott Gilman: she also said this: "On the other hand, I will say that in other collaborative projects with Puerto Rico partners (e.g. University of Hawaii and UPR) where similar exchanges have happened for on-the-fly translation checks. As long as the ask is respectful and the partner is willing to help on their own time and terms, in my experience, there is little to no harm done."
10/25/18, 11:03 AM - Scott Gilman: but you're right it's a draft fundamentally. it's not even like she's helping us translate waht we want to translate.
10/25/18, 11:03 AM - Collyn Chan: But i don't understand why, we had an order of operations he is deviating from
10/25/18, 11:04 AM - Collyn Chan: And we have that order for both being respectful and to give him time to find a translator
10/25/18, 11:04 AM - Collyn Chan: Like I don't even understand where his head is at

10/25/18, 11:09 AM - Collyn Chan: Yes please -🏼-🏼-🏼 thank you lily ---
10/25/18, 11:09 AM - Collyn Chan: But also thanks for being willing to send it
10/25/18, 11:09 AM - Collyn Chan: ): <
10/25/18, 11:11 AM - Scott Gilman: lolol if david only knew how much lily is still behind the scenes.........
10/25/18, 11:16 AM - Collyn Chan: Yeah ---she should teach the fall class
10/25/18, 11:16 AM - Collyn Chan: And he should be the advisory
10/25/18, 11:16 AM - Collyn Chan: Person or whatever

12/22/18, 11:46 AM - Collyn Chan: I hate waking up lol
12/22/18, 12:42 PM - Scott Gilman: I'm sorry bb :( :(
12/22/18, 12:43 PM - Scott Gilman: I'm reading your email
12/22/18, 12:43 PM - Scott Gilman: I'm going to try to make it into 5 sentences and send it to you to see what you think
12/22/18, 1:03 PM - Collyn Chan: Lol yeah I have no idea what I'm saying or doing with this email
12/22/18, 1:04 PM - Collyn Chan: I think going outside helps but it's so rainy
12/22/18, 7:15 PM - Collyn Chan: Scottttttt
12/22/18, 7:16 PM - Collyn Chan: I need to write more angry things lol
12/22/18, 7:16 PM - Collyn Chan: I shouldn't be friends with her >:( I decide that rwarrr
12/22/18, 7:16 PM - Scott Gilman: Okkkk how are you feeling about that decision?
12/22/18, 7:24 PM - Collyn Chan: <Media omitted>
12/22/18, 7:24 PM - Collyn Chan: Also aos
12/22/18, 7:24 PM - Collyn Chan: Wow
12/22/18, 7:24 PM - Scott Gilman: Lol so couv
12/22/18, 7:24 PM - Collyn Chan: Anyway idk but for right now it's feeling pretty okay. I'm sad but it's not like I haven't been thinking that
12/22/18, 7:25 PM - Collyn Chan: Anyway how was my email wasn't it so much
12/22/18, 7:25 PM - Collyn Chan: Our relationship had to die I shouldn't let the parts of it that were okay overshadow the reasons I did what I did. And I'm really upset that she's been so unkind idk
12/22/18, 7:26 PM - Scott Gilman: Yeah that's totally valid. At some point if you're the only one putting in work to repair it you have to give yourself a break and let go
12/22/18, 7:26 PM - Scott Gilman: But obviously it's fresh. I'll be interested to hear your thoughts   after sleeping on it
12/22/18, 7:27 PM - Scott Gilman: Lol yes there was a lot in the email
12/22/18, 7:29 PM - Collyn Chan: I've been thinking about it for over a week lol. I'm kind of just like what the fuck and then Im like how do I do that nicely and mean it. How do I remove hate and resentment from doing it.
12/22/18, 7:30 PM - Collyn Chan: I mean even if she says all the right things you know
12/22/18, 7:30 PM - Collyn Chan: This isn't okay, right?
12/22/18, 7:31 PM - Scott Gilman: What isn't okay?
12/22/18, 7:31 PM - Collyn Chan: How she asked for what she needed, treating me like she has in the past couple of weeks?
12/22/18, 7:32 PM - Scott Gilman: No.
12/22/18, 7:34 PM - Scott Gilman: I don't think you owe her an explanation. She knows how upset you are, she knows what she's doing to upset you, and she knows she's prioritizing her feelings over yours.
12/22/18, 7:34 PM - Scott Gilman: But if you would feel better giving her an explanation, you could start with a brain dump of what you're thinking, edit it down, and then say that to her and minimize discussion after the fsct
12/22/18, 7:40 PM - Collyn Chan: Lol yeah I mean maybe maybe she doesn't. Most of all, it's the fact that she's been blaming it on me. How many times have I just taken it from her because I knew she needed me to be there.
12/22/18, 7:40 PM - Collyn Chan: I told you about nisa right? Lol
12/22/18, 7:40 PM - Collyn Chan: I don't really know how to say it without being this angry.
12/22/18, 7:41 PM - Collyn Chan: I have no room in my life for this anger and frustration and pain.
12/22/18, 7:44 PM - Scott Gilman: What's nisa?
12/22/18, 7:46 PM - Scott Gilman: Idk maybe you need to say it this angry
12/22/18, 7:47 PM - Scott Gilman: If you're tempering your tone that's totally for her benefit so it's a question of how much do you want to do for her
12/22/18, 7:56 PM - Collyn Chan: I mean I think I'm trying to temper myself for my benefit cause I don't like being angry and upset.
12/22/18, 7:57 PM - Collyn Chan: Nisa is this friend of hers thst was here and basically was like you're leaving and I don't think you've been a very good friend to me and she talked to me about it and was all like "I can't believe she blamed me"
12/22/18, 7:57 PM - Collyn Chan: And I was like ---
12/22/18, 7:58 PM - Scott Gilman: Ohh did this happen in the spring?
12/22/18, 7:58 PM - Scott Gilman: Yeah I remember that
12/22/18, 8:06 PM - Collyn Chan: Yeah in the spring
12/22/18, 8:06 PM - Collyn Chan: But yeah idk I want to feel calm and sure and not angry. I'm not even saying this is forever cause nothing is. But right now, I don't want her to even pretend like this is okay.
12/22/18, 8:07 PM - Collyn Chan: I don't want me to pretend like this is okay.
12/22/18, 8:07 PM - Collyn Chan: Anyway
12/22/18, 8:07 PM - Collyn Chan: Idk I'm still angry and I don't like it. When I decide I decide and I'm sure in that and I need to be so sure of this and not be angry or sad :(
12/22/18, 8:07 PM - Collyn Chan: Anywayyy, this relationship had to die it just didn't have to die like this.
12/22/18, 8:08 PM - Collyn Chan: >:(
12/22/18, 8:08 PM - Collyn Chan: How was your day!

12/23/18, 1:44 PM - Collyn Chan: Okay, thank you. I agree with everyone except the making the ground rules thing
12/23/18, 1:45 PM - Collyn Chan: I mean I'm a bit pissed it hasn't happened yet
12/23/18, 1:45 PM - Collyn Chan: And I want an apology, really, before we actually go into it
12/23/18, 1:45 PM - Scott Gilman: What is this omg
12/23/18, 1:45 PM - Collyn Chan: It's an animoji!!!
12/23/18, 1:45 PM - Scott Gilman: From Kelly or Mario?

12/23/18, 1:48 PM - Collyn Chan: Thanks for writing this email :( it was probably really hard to boil all that down to this lol
12/23/18, 1:48 PM - Collyn Chan: Clearly
12/23/18, 1:48 PM - Collyn Chan: Cause I couldn't
12/23/18, 1:48 PM - Collyn Chan: But also I don't know what my ask is anymore
12/23/18, 1:49 PM - Collyn Chan: I've been yelling in my head that if she can't recognize all the reasons why it was hurtful that we can't move forward
12/23/18, 1:51 PM - Scott Gilman: Yeah I think that's the most challenging part. I think definitely start with ground rules and an apology from Kelly. And then add apology from Mario if needed
12/23/18, 2:02 PM - Collyn Chan: I don't want to do ground rules until she apologizes
12/23/18, 2:02 PM - Collyn Chan: >:(
12/23/18, 2:07 PM - Scott Gilman: But is that something mario needs to be in olved in?
12/23/18, 2:08 PM - Collyn Chan: I mean yes considering her complete inability to do it by herself lol
12/23/18, 2:08 PM - Collyn Chan: But also he's allowing her to not do it
12/23/18, 2:08 PM - Collyn Chan: Like she should apologize because the last 3 weeks didn't have to be like this
12/23/18, 2:08 PM - Collyn Chan: None of this had to be like this >:(

1/22/19, 5:51 PM - Collyn Chan: This tool might work better for places like chicago cause their regional coordination is relatively strong and CMAP would be a good place to house it?

1/22/19, 5:51 PM - Collyn Chan: Yeah
1/22/19, 5:51 PM - Scott Gilman: Also might be good in schools

1/23/19, 12:01 AM - Collyn Chan: And I depended a lot on my friends and it was a lot of onus on me to be communicative and understanding and unconditional with how I care for people to make my own family
1/23/19, 12:01 AM - Collyn Chan: Not that I don't love my family.
1/23/19, 12:03 AM - Collyn Chan: But I don't really think there's an example of love that I can say was good. And I used to idealize it. But I think watching my friends, I see a lot of different things now.
1/23/19, 12:03 AM - Collyn Chan: Anyway answer my question Scott what is love how do you know ~~~ Whitney

1/23/19, 12:10 AM - Scott Gilman: but i will try
1/23/19, 12:11 AM - Collyn Chan: Oh you decided to do thst lol
1/23/19, 12:12 AM - Scott Gilman: i think loving someone is a conscious action, ie the part of love that you have to actively do
1/23/19, 12:12 AM - Scott Gilman: being in love is a state of being, something you have less agency over. the part of love that feels out of control
1/23/19, 12:12 AM - Scott Gilman: but they're two sides to the same coin
1/23/19, 12:13 AM - Scott Gilman: unless you just have a bad crush on someone, you need to love them and be in love with them
1/23/19, 12:14 AM - Scott Gilman: and when you first feel like you're in love with someone it kind of just falls on you, but when you say "i love you" that's a choice that you have to think about
1/23/19, 12:14 AM - Scott Gilman: and then hopefully you back up that choice with other words and actions and commitments
1/23/19, 12:15 AM - Collyn Chan: What!!
1/23/19, 12:16 AM - Collyn Chan: But I like that definition. The choice part.
1/23/19, 12:18 AM - Collyn Chan: Does being in love make you make different choices tho
1/23/19, 12:18 AM - Collyn Chan: shouldn't people still be individuals?!
1/23/19, 12:18 AM - Scott Gilman: yah prolly

change and design better experiences, I need to expand my depth of knowledge in
environmental planning and policy to apply my capabilities in urban development. MIT’s city
planning program is a pivotal component of achieving my objective as I will use it to enhance
my subject matter expertise and expand my efforts to a global scale.
